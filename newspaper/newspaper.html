                            out of Afghanistan for a number of British nationals and Afghans who remain there.

                            in the country. It comes after a Taliban pledge to allow further departures.

                        <p>A law banning abortion from as early as six weeks into pregnancy has come into effect 
                            in the US state of Texas.It bans abortions after the detection of what anti-abortion 
                            campaigners call a foetal heartbeat, something medical authorities say is misleading.
                            The law, one of the most restrictive in the country, took effect after the Supreme 
                            Court did not respond to an emergency appeal by abortion providers.

                            the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), then requested that the Supreme Court
